# Docker-Ubuntu - ARM64 Linux

This repo demonstrates ARM cross-compilation, GoogleTest, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

---

## Test Results (GoogleTest)

[![tests](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/dangorozco/docker-ubuntu/ci.yml?label=tests&job=tests)](https://github.com/dangorozco/docker-ubuntu/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amain)

This badge reflects the status of the **GoogleTest suite** (`results.xml`) executed in the `tests` job.  
Clicking the badge will take you to the **CI workflow runs page**, where you can open the latest run **unit tests** to view detailed GoogleTest results.

---

## Continuous Integration (CI)

![CI](https://github.com/dangorozco/docker-ubuntu/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

The **CI badge** above shows the current build status of the project.  
Every commit and pull request automatically triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Cross-compiles the code for ARM64.  
- Builds and runs the native test suite using GoogleTest.  
- Performs static analysis checks with `clang-tidy`.  

This ensures the codebase is always buildable, tested, and validated before integration.

## Test Coverage

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/dangorozco/docker-ubuntu/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/dangorozco/docker-ubuntu)

[![Coverage Report](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-HTML-green)](https://dangorozco.github.io/docker-ubuntu/)

This project integrates automated test coverage reporting into the CI/CD pipeline.  
Coverage is collected with **LCOV** during each GitHub Actions run, then uploaded to **Codecov** for tracking and visualization.  
In addition, a browsable **HTML Coverage Report** is generated and published via GitHub Pages.

- ðŸŸ¢ **Codecov Badge** (above) shows the current unit test coverage percentage.  
- ðŸ“Š **Detailed Coverage Report** is available as an interactive HTML view: [Coverage Report](https://dangorozco.github.io/docker-ubuntu/)  
- ðŸ”„ Ensures every commit is tested, progress is tracked over time, and critical functions remain covered.

This provides both a quick at-a-glance view (Codecov badge) and a detailed breakdown of test coverage across the codebase.

## Developer Guide

This section provides step-by-step instructions for new contributors to build, test, and push changes to this project.  
The project demonstrates **ARM cross-compilation (AArch64)**, **GoogleTest unit testing**, and **automated CI/CD pipelines** with **GitHub Actions + Codecov**.

---

### 1. Prerequisites

On your local machine (Linux, macOS, or WSL2), install the following:

- **CMake** (â‰¥ 3.16)
- **GCC / G++** (native build)
- **Cross-compiler toolchain** for ARM64:
  - `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`
  - `g++-aarch64-linux-gnu`
- **GoogleTest** (`libgtest-dev`)
- **LCOV** (for coverage reports)
- **Clang-Tidy** (optional: static analysis)
- **Git**

If on **macOS**
Install docker app and run it
open homebrew terminal
```bash
docker run -it \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  --name my-ubuntu-dev \
  ubuntu:22.04 bash-
```
After docker gets permission to access local hardware and folders then it shows the /workspace a seen below

On **Ubuntu/Debian**:
```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu \
    git cmake make vim nano qemu-user \
    lcov clang-tidy git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  
```

On **macOS**:

If you use VS Code, thereâ€™s a Remote - Containers plugin that lets you open the Docker container as if it were your dev environment.
	â€¢	You write code in VS Code on macOS.
	â€¢	It syncs directly into the container.
	â€¢	Very popular in professional embedded + DevOps setups.

	â€¢	Install the VS Code extension: Dev Containers.
	â€¢	Press F1 â†’ search Dev Containers: Attach to Running Containerâ€¦.
	â€¢	Pick my-ubuntu-dev.
	â€¢	Your /workspace folder will be visible.
	â€¢	You can edit, build, debug all inside VS Code, using the containerâ€™s toolchain.

Once the folder is opened, the .json and cmake files shown below should be updated for the ARM 64 
Also C/C++ extension module should be installed

2. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/dangorozco/docker-ubuntu.git
cd docker-ubuntu

---

3. Native Build (x86_64)

Build the project natively on your machine (for fast iteration):

cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build -- -j$(nproc)

Run the binary:

./build/hello


---

4. ARM64 Cross-Compilation

Build the project for ARM64 using the provided toolchain file:

cmake -B build-arm64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=arm64-toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-arm64 -- -j$(nproc)

This produces binaries that can run on ARM64 Linux environments (e.g., Raspberry Pi, embedded boards, Docker ARM emulation).

---

5. Run Unit Tests (GoogleTest)

Unit tests are located in tests/. Build and run them natively:

cmake -B build-tests -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage
cmake --build build-tests -- -j$(nproc)
./build-tests/test_hello --gtest_output=xml:results.xml

Expected output:

[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test suite.
[ RUN      ] HelloTest.SayHelloReturnsZero
[       OK ] HelloTest.SayHelloReturnsZero (0 ms)
[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)


---

6. Generate Coverage Report (Local)

lcov --capture --directory build-tests --output-file build-tests/coverage.info
lcov --remove build-tests/coverage.info '/usr/*' --output-file build-tests/coverage.info
genhtml build-tests/coverage.info --output-directory build-tests/coverage-html

Open in browser:

open build-tests/coverage-html/index.html   # macOS
xdg-open build-tests/coverage-html/index.html  # Linux


---

7. GitHub CI/CD Pipeline

Every push to main automatically:
	â€¢	Builds natively and cross-compiles for ARM64.
	â€¢	Runs GoogleTests (results.xml uploaded via dorny/test-reporter).
	â€¢	Uploads coverage results to Codecov.
	â€¢	Publishes an HTML coverage report to GitHub Pages:
ðŸ‘‰ Coverage Report

Badges:
	â€¢	CI: 

	â€¢	Tests: 

	â€¢	Code Coverage: 


---

8. Contributing Workflow
	1.	Create a new branch:

git checkout -b feature/my-change


	2.	Make your changes (source code in hello.c, tests in tests/).
	3.	Format and lint code (optional but recommended):

clang-tidy hello.c -- -I.


	4.	Commit your changes:

git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new function X with tests"


	5.	Push your branch:

git push origin feature/my-change


	6.	Open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub for review.

All PRs will automatically trigger CI/CD, running tests + coverage checks.

9. Resources
	â€¢	GoogleTest Docs
	â€¢	CMake Documentation
	â€¢	Codecov
	â€¢	GitHub Actions

cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/hello

ðŸ‘‰ This is now a **drop-in section** for your `README.md`.  
Itâ€™s structured, beginner-friendly, and matches your projectâ€™s CI/CD setup.  

Would you like me to also create a **short "Project Architecture" diagram** (tools + flow: Developer â†’ GitHub â†’ Actions â†’ Codecov â†’ Pages) to embed in README.md for newcomers?
